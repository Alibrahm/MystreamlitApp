This is a web app to analyse a dataset logged from my custom desktop application that logs the data in real-time received from an arduino pro mini wearable that monitors body temperature, heart rate and blood percentage. This is for final year project purposes. A max30100 was used, and I would advise getting a grove sensor thats more reliable and stable in reading data
